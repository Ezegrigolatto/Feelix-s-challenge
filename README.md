## Challenge Steps

### 1️⃣ Environment Configuration

When using Next.js apps, you need to prefix your environment variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to make them accessible on the client side.

Never store or expose sensitive information such as secrets, database credentials, or JWT secret keys in environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. These variables are compiled into the JavaScript bundle and can be accessed by anyone inspecting your application's source code in the browser.

For sensitive information, use environment variables **without** the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix. These variables will only be available on the server side.

#### Environment Files

| File                              | Purpose                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `.env.development` / `.env.local` | Development mode (`next dev`)    |
| `.env.staging`                    | Pre-production / QA environments |
| `.env.production`                 | Production deployments           |

---

### 2️⃣ Dashboard API Integration

The dashboard uses a mock API to simulate fetching user data. The mock API is located in `app/api/analytics/route.ts`.

**File:** `page.tsx` - Dashboard page (home)

- ✅ Fetches data from the mock API endpoint (`/api/analytics`)
- ✅ Displays total users, active users, revenue and conversions
- ✅ Filters data by date range (last 7 days, last 30 days, last 90 days), category and user status
- ✅ Displays charts using recharts library
- ✅ Displays data table for data breakdown by category

---

### 3️⃣ State & Error Handling

The dashboard page:

- ✅ Handles loading, empty, and error states
- ✅ Simulates network delay for realism
- ✅ Simulates error scenario with a 1/10 chance

---

### 4️⃣ Email / Phone Verification Flow

**File:** `verify/page.tsx` - Verification page

- ✅ Extracts the token from the query params (`/verify?token=xxxx`)
- ✅ Auto-submits on page load with `useEffect`
- ✅ Loading state with animated spinner
- ✅ Success message with green icon
- ✅ Auto-redirects to `/login` after 3 seconds with visible countdown
- ✅ Error message with red icon
- ✅ "Resend Verification" button with email field
- ✅ States for resend (loading, success, error)

**File:** `api/auth/verify/route.ts` - Verification endpoint

- Validates presence of the token
- Handles already used, expired, and invalid tokens
- Simulates valid tokens for testing (`valid-token-123`, `test-token`)

**File:** `api/auth/resend-verification/route.ts` - Resend endpoint

- Email format validation
- Rate limiting (3 attempts every 15 minutes)
- Prevents email enumeration (always returns generic success)
- Detects if the email is already verified (use `verified@example.com` for testing)

#### Test URLs

| URL                               | Result              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `/verify?token=valid-token-123`   | ✅ Success          |
| `/verify?token=expired-token-456` | ❌ Error (expired)  |
| `/verify?token=invalid`           | ❌ Error (invalid)  |
| `/verify`                         | ❌ Error (no token) |

---

### 5️⃣ Password Reset Flow

#### 5.1 Forgot Password (`/forgot-password`)

**File:** `forgot-password/page.tsx`

- ✅ Email input with validation
- ✅ Loading state with spinner
- ✅ Success message: "Please check your email to reset your password"
- ✅ Option to try another email
- ✅ API error handling
- ✅ Link back to login

**File:** `api/auth/password-reset-request/route.ts`

- Rate limiting (3 attempts every 15 minutes)
- Prevention of email enumeration
- Email format validation

#### 5.2 Reset Password (`/reset-password?token=xxxx`)

**File:** `reset-password/page.tsx`

- ✅ Extracts token from query params
- ✅ Form with New Password and Confirm Password
- ✅ Toggle to show/hide password
- ✅ Password strength indicator (Weak/Medium/Strong/Very Strong)
- ✅ Frontend validation: match, minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, number
- ✅ Visual confirmation when passwords match
- ✅ Loading and error states
- ✅ Auto-redirect to login after 3 seconds with countdown

**File:** `api/auth/password-reset-confirm/route.ts`

- Token validation (valid, expired, used)
- Backend password validation
- Test tokens: `valid-reset-token`, `test-reset-token`

#### Test URLs

| URL                                       | Result              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `/forgot-password`                        | Request reset       |
| `/reset-password?token=valid-reset-token` | ✅ Successful reset |
| `/reset-password?token=invalid`           | ❌ Token error      |
| `/reset-password`                         | ❌ Error (no token) |

> **Note:** A login page has been included for completeness, but the authentication logic is not implemented as it is outside the scope of this challenge. It simply provides navigation to avoid dead ends.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

## Answering to challenge's questions

1. How do these flows behave differently: Development, Staging, and Production.

In Development, the main goal is speed when delivering features and debugging.
Mocked APIs, fake data, relaxed validations, detailed logs, hot reload, and quick experiments are allowed.

In Staging, the goal is realism and production replication.
This environment should mirror production as closely as possible: same auth flows, same middleware, same build process, same validations. Staging exists to catch integration and configuration issues, not basic logic bugs.

In Production, the focus shifts to stability, resilience, and observability.
You want controlled error handling, proper fallbacks, timeouts, retries, monitoring, and minimal console noise. This is where real users, real data, real latency, and weird edge cases show up.

2. What frontend mistakes commonly break CI/CD pipelines?

- Library version mismatches between local and CI environments due to lockfile discrepancies.

- Missing or misnamed environment variables that exist locally but not in CI.

- Import issues.

- TSC errors that are ignored locally but fail in CI.

- Linting or formatting rules enforced in CI but ignored locally such as console statements, any allowances, unused vars, etc.

- Build-time errors caused by using browser-only APIs during SSR or static builds.

3. How do you protect frontend code from backend API changes?

- Use shared contracts or schemas when possible (OpenAPI, GraphQL, runtime validation).

- Implement versioning for APIs to avoid breaking changes.

- Be defensive: optional fields, defaults, and graceful fallbacks.

- If possible, share a typing catalog, use code generation tools or validators like ZOD that warn you before the code is deployed.

4. How should tokens be handled safely in frontend authentication flows?

- Avoid storing tokens or sensitive data in localStorage or sessionStorage due to XSS risks. HttpOnly cookies are preferred in this case.

- Use short lifetimes for access tokens and refresh them securely.

- Implement proper token invalidation on logout or expiration.

- Handle token expiration correctly.
